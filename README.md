Game Rules:

The game board consists of a row of colored pegs.
The computer will randomly select a secret code, which is a combination of four colors.
Your task is to guess the secret code in as few turns as possible.
After each guess, the computer will provide feedback in the form of black and white pegs:
A black peg indicates a correct color in the correct position.
A white peg indicates a correct color in the wrong position.
Use the feedback to make educated guesses and crack the code!
How to Play:

Enter your guess in the input field provided. You can use the colors R, G, B, Y, O, P to make your guess.
Click the "Submit Guess" button to submit your guess.
The game board will display your guess along with the feedback from the computer.
Keep guessing until you either guess the correct code or reach the maximum number of turns (10).
Additional Features:

The game keeps track of your past guesses and displays them on the screen.
If you fail to guess the code within 10 turns, the game will reveal the secret code, and you will lose.
Have fun playing Mastermind!
